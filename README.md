## Introduction

* [Keras](https://keras.io/getting_started/) : Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras uses TensorFlow or Theano libraries as backend. Keras is a powerful and easy-to-use free open source library for developing and evaluating deep learning models. We utilizi lots of built-in functions

* [DIGIT RECOGNITION MNIST in CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv) : The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. In our example, we use this dataset and download with this kaggle adress.

## Requirements & Dependencies
* We build our algorithm using "Anaconda Environment" on Jupyter Notebook.
* Required packages and libraries are given as txt file (bio-enc.txt). You can directly create environment like this:
  
  ```bash
  conda env create --file bio-env.txt
  ```

## Usage
* Download this repo and run "mnist-digit-recognition.ipynb" file jupyter notebook.
* Download dataset from above link and exract csv files (test and train) to the same file where your code is
